I am also interested in startups, and hope to have my own startup one day. I am particularly interested in projects that touch mental health, persoanl growth, social impact and tourism. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2003 when I was 6. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Road Rash, Solitaire, and Mario. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.
- 2001: I survived 2001 Earthquake

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
